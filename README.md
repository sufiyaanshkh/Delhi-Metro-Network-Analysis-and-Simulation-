## 📌 Project Overview

This simulation allows you to:
- Model metro stations and their interconnections with distances.
- Visualize and interact with the Delhi Metro network using a simple GUI.
- Analyze connections, explore routes, and understand the structure of the metro system.

The project structure uses:
- **`metro_network.py`**: Contains the `MetroNetwork` class to manage stations and connections.
- **`metro_gui.py`**: Contains the `MetroGUI` class that builds the graphical user interface.
- **`main.py`** (your script): Initializes the network and launches the GUI.
